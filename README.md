## Hi, I’m Etisham :)

I am a self-taught full-stack developer, currently learning the MERN tech stack. 
I have experience coding in Python and have made a few personal projects which you can find in my repos. I also have used MySQL for work projects.

I have recently learnt HTML, CSS and Bootstrap and I am now working on learning JavaScript.
